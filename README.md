# Team Profile Generator

This application allows the user (in this case, another developer) to generate a webpage for the purpose of organizing team members for any particular project. Using the command line and Node.js, the user is prompted first to enter the name of the manager, or project leader. They are then prompted to enter the information of any Engineers and/or Interns also involved with said project. Each prompt differs slightly, asking for an Office Number for the manager, a GitHub link for any Engineers, and a School for any Interns. The user will follow through with each prompt, and when they have entered any and all relative information, and HTML file is generated. The links to an Engineer's GitHub account are hyperlinked within this generated HTML file, as are the email addresses of all team members.

# Walkthrough Video

This video shows how the user would generate a webpage using only the prompts in the command line after running node app.js in the develop folder. I have included a link to the video, as well as an admittedly low-quality gif, so hopefully it can be easlily viewed.
